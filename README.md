# Save time in Autodesk Fusion 360 with the parameter list.

My first example is an all in on list for the construction of 3d printers.

This list for 3d printers contains the most important dimensions and mechanical components.
Adapt the values to your needs.

You can add to them or shorten them.

The parameters are basically variables.
With parameters you can comfortably and clearly change your dimensions, quantities, etc.

You can also export the list and import it into other constructions.

### parameter files
| topic |	directory | list file | explanation |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 3d printer | [3d printer](/3d%20printer/) | [3d printer template](/3d%20printer/3d%20printer%20parameter%20list%20autodesk%20fusion%20360.csv/) | List with many (>100) dimensions for the construction of a 3d printer, including various standard components  |

### Especially complex constructions with numerous changes require a good parameter list.

## Note the following:
- The entries cannot be sorted within Fusion.
- The newest entries are at the bottom.
- Spaces are not supported in the name.
- Think about which values you need right at the beginning.
- Create the list in a sensible order.
- Use the Fusion Parameter I/O APP to import / export the list. 
- You can edit the list outside of Fusion.
- You cannot overwrite lists or change the order afterwards. However, you can import your optimised list into a newly created file.
- If you need numerical values without units, set the unit to an empty entry.


You want to create a file outside Fusion.
Take a csv or txt file with the following structure.

```
nema_17_outer_XY, mm, 43 mm, nema 17 stepper
nema_17_outer_z, mm, 40 mm, nema 17 stepper
nema_17_screw_distance, mm, 31 mm, nema 17 stepper
```

Familiarise yourself with parameter lists:
